   The Neurokit2 toolbox is an open-source Python package aimed at providing users with comprehensive functionality and flexibility in neurophysiological signal processing. It developed from a collaborative project aimed at offering programming ease for both novice and advanced users to perform elaborate analyses of neurophysiological data. 

   Algorithms first for basic and high-level analysis such as..... Allows users to perform elaborate    can extend functionaliy and implement new algorithms
   
   from a collaborative project

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
