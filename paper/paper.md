- neurophysiological methods more and more common to study cognitive neuroscience and psychology, because they are 1) cheap, 2) convenient (smart watches), and 3) better computational methods and algorithms are appearing.
- Unfortunately, these methods are often not easily easily accessible and useable, and analyzing neurophysiological signals is still a challenge for most researchers without a strong background in computer science.
- NeuroKit was written by neuroscientists and psychologists for neuroscientists and psychologists, to be 1) accessible, 2) well-documented, 3) cutting-edge, 4) Powerful and flexible.


- Accessibility: Python, open-source
- Documentation: links, tutorials, examples
- Cutting-edge: evolutive through collaborative environment.
- Reliable: Bug reports, open-source, clear code organization. Test covereage, + it has also been tested against existing reference software.
- Powerful and flexible: API
